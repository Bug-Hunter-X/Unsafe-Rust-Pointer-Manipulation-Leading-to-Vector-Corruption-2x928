This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust when working with raw pointers and vectors. The `bug.rs` file shows code that attempts to modify a vector's contents directly through a raw pointer, which can lead to undefined behavior, as the vector's internal data structures and capacity information are not managed correctly after the pointer manipulation. The `bugSolution.rs` file demonstrates the correct and safe way to modify vector contents, avoiding raw pointer manipulations.
